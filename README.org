* About 

MUSS is a style sheet for BibLaTeX that seeks minimality in different ways:

1) Minimality of supported entry types: MUSS supports only a small set of entry types and fields that I consider most important in my field (computational linguistics/natural language processing). 
2) Minimality of backward compatiblity: MUSS will only be compatible with recent versions of BibLaTeX.
3) Minimality of code: Because of (1) and (2), MUSS has a very slim codebase and is maximally self-contained. In fact, there is only *one* generic driver which is used for articles, books, etc.

MUSS was heavily inspired by, but uses only certain characteristics of,

- Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics (USS), a set of general style rules for references
  (see https://langsci-press.org/unifiedstylesheet)
- langsci-unified.bbx, a BibLaTeX implementation of the USS that is part of the
  langscibook class (see https://github.com/langsci/langscibook),
  and therefore also biblatex-unified.bbx, on which langsci-unified.bbx is based
  (see https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified)

MUSS comes with two files:

- muss.bbx specifies the structure and formatting of entries in a list of references.
- muss.cbx specifies the look of cite commands in the text.

List of currently supported entry types:
article, book, collection, incollection, inproceedings, manual, online, (phd)thesis,
(tech)report

List of currently supported entry fields (depending on the entry type):
author, booktitle, doi, edition, editor, institution, journal, note, number, pages,
publisher, school, title, type, url, urldate, volume, year

Yes, there is no address field; this is a deliberate decision.

* The entry structure of MUSS

MUSS assumes that an entry in the list of references consists of the parts AUTHOR, YEAR, TITLE, TYPEOF, PARTOF, ACCESS and NOTE, which are associated with different fields depending on the type of reference:

| Entry parts $\to$ | AUTHOR | YEAR | TITLE           | TYPEOF                   | PARTOF                         | ACCESS                     | NOTE |
|-----------------+--------+------+-----------------+--------------------------+--------------------------------+----------------------------+------|
| article         | author | year | title           |                          | journal, pages, volume, number | doi/url+urldate            | note |
| book            | author | year | title           | series, number           | edition                        | publisher, doi/url+urldate | note |
| collection      | editor | year | title/booktitle | series, number           | edition                        | publisher, doi/url+urldate | note |
| incollection    | author | year | title           |                          | @collection, pages             | doi/url+urldate            | note |
| inproceedings   | author | year | title           |                          | booktitle, pages               | doi/url+urldate            | note |
| manual          | author | year | title           |                          |                                | doi/url+urldate            | note |
| online          | author | year | title           |                          |                                | doi/url+urldate            | note |
| (phd)thesis     | author | year | title           | type, school/instutition |                                | doi/url+urldate            | note |
| (tech)report    | author | year | title           | type, institution        |                                | doi/url+urldate            | note |

Note that MUSS itself does not distinguish between obligatory and optional fields. Missing fields are simply ignored.

* Differences to the Unified Style Sheet

MUSS mainly differs from USS in the following details:
- PARTOF is preceded by "In" also with articles. In USS, journal names are not preceded by "In".
- There is no address field. Never.
- If no DOI is provided, the URL is printed. Not both.
- The publisher is only printed with books and collections.
- Notes are printed in square brackets at the very end to make them easier to recognize.

For comparison, see the output of MUSS in [[file:tests/test-muss.pdf]] and the output of USS in [[file:tests/test-langsci-unified.pdf]] using langsci-unified.bbx.

* Requirements and dependencies

The most recent version of MUSS is tested with BibLaTeX v3.20.

* Installation and use

Simply copy muss.bbx and muss.cbx to your LaTeX project and tell BibLaTeX to use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC latex 
\usepackage[
  bibstyle=muss,
  citestyle=muss,
  ]{biblatex}
#+END_SRC

Take a look at [[file:tests/test-muss.tex]] for a complete example.

* Roadmap

- [X] Overhaul muss.cbx
      - [X] Remove outdated code
      - [X] Simplify code
- [X] Add default value for type in @thesis
- [X] Add type and institution in @report
- [X] Add CSL file
